3 layer:

API DAOs
APIDAO is the interface which is implemented by APIDAOImpl provides function get data by an API URL for some DAOs that extends.
CustomerDAOImpl, ActivityDAOImpl and TrackingDAOImpl are sub classes implements CustomerDAO, ActivityDAO, TrackingDAO intefaces. 
These interfaces extends APIDAO which use the data getted from another API provider to do bussiness logic for Service (in section 5) 
or return data based on Customer, Activity or Tracking Model (in section 3) 


Hibernate DAOs
Similar to APIDAO there are some DAOs mapping with Hibernate such as AdminDAO, HotelRoomDAO, RestaurantDAO. They works as same as the DAOs in section 3 but
interact with SQL database for data instead of data from other API provider.
